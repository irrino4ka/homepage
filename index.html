                            <span>Jackman holds the world record for most superhero film appearances for his role of Logan/Wolverine.
                                He’s also the only actor to star in all chapters of the X-Men franchise.</span>

                            <span>To build his body for The Wolverine, Hugh Jackman followed a brutal nutrition plan recommended
                                to him by Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. Besides vigorous training, he had to consume 6,000 calories
                                per day. As a comparison, average sedentary men need between 2,000 to 2,600 calories per
                                day.

                            <span>He Passed on Casino Royale. Although there’s no doubt Jackman would make an awesome James Bond,
                                he turned down the role of the British spy in the mid-2000s.</span>

                            <span>He was a last-minute addition to the X-Men (2000) cast. Dougray Scott was originally cast as
                                Wolverine, but Mission: Impossible II (2000) required two extra months of shooting.</span>
